                <p class="section-text1"> Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. 
                    The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people 
                    living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in 
                    love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn 
                    sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe 
                    inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and 
                    provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the 
                    longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water 
                    is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer 
                    in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children 
                    who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

                <p class="section-text2"> Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, 
                    the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey 
                    stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. 
                    This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green 
                    River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, 
                    evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater 
                    opportunities.

                    Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This designation 
                    is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.

                    Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking 
                    scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled 
                    not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient 
                    indian ruins accessible only by river.

                    CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in 
                    the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide 
                    variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar with 
                    the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.
