        Hello, my name is Chris. I live in California, just north of Los Angeles. A you can see
        from the picture my son and I enjoy going to Disneyland! I am a single Dad, with a son named CJ who is 11.
        I work in sales, don't really enjoy it much, which is why I am taking classes. I am taking classes
        because I want to become a web developer. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Things that we enjoy doing are going to the movies, playing games, 
        bike riding, building computers, going to see the Dodgers, Disneyland, and spending
        time with friends and family. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am excited to take this class. 
        It will be a lot of fun to learn from everyone this semester!
